# Question:

# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

# A valid BST is defined as follows:

# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: true

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def helper(node, low, high):
            if not node:
                return True
            if not (low < node.val < high):
                return False
            return helper(node.left, low, node.val) and helper(node.right, node.val, high)
        
        return helper(root, -inf, inf)
